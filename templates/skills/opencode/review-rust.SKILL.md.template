# Rust Code Review Skill

Review Rust code changes against the project's comprehensive Rust guidelines and best practices.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Identify Changed Rust Files

Run `git diff --name-only` to find which Rust files have changed.

### Step 2: Discover Available Guidelines

The Rust guidelines are located at: `{{PROJECT_ROOT}}/.aiassisted/guidelines/rust/`

To see all available guidelines, use glob: `{{PROJECT_ROOT}}/.aiassisted/guidelines/rust/*.md`

### Step 3: Load Relevant Guidelines

Based on the code patterns you see, load the appropriate guidelines:

| Code Pattern | Guideline File |
|--------------|----------------|
| Enums, structs, pattern matching | `rust-adt-implementation-guide.md` |
| Builder pattern usage | `rust-builder-pattern-guide.md` |
| Cargo.toml, dependencies | `rust-dependency-management-guide.md` |
| Trait objects, generics | `rust-dispatch-guide.md` |
| Factory pattern | `rust-factory-pattern-guide.md` |
| Type-level state machines | `rust-typestate-pattern-guide.md` |
| General Rust practices | `microsoft-rust-guidelines.md` |

### Step 4: Review Code

Read the changed files and compare against the loaded guidelines.

### Step 5: Provide Feedback

Format your review as:

#### ✅ Strengths
- What follows guidelines well

#### ⚠️ Issues
- File and line number
- Guideline violated (cite specific guideline file)
- Recommended fix

#### 💡 Suggestions
- Optional improvements

## Guidelines Location

**Path**: `{{PROJECT_ROOT}}/.aiassisted/guidelines/rust/`

**Available as of skill creation**:
{{RUST_GUIDELINES_LIST}}

**Note**: This list may be outdated. Always use glob to discover current guidelines.

## Important

- Always load guidelines fresh from `.aiassisted/` - don't rely on cached knowledge
- Cite specific guideline files and sections in your feedback
- The guidelines are the source of truth
