# Git Commit Skill

Commit current changes to the git repository following the Conventional Commits specification.

## Instructions

To create a proper commit:

1. **Read the commit guidelines**:
   - Primary: `{{PROJECT_ROOT}}/.aiassisted/prompts/git.commit.prompt.md`
   - Reference: `{{PROJECT_ROOT}}/.aiassisted/instructions/conventional-commits.instructions.md`

2. **Review changes**:
   - Run `git status` to see staged/unstaged files
   - Run `git diff` to review actual changes

3. **Analyze and commit**:
   - Determine appropriate commit type based on changes
   - Create commit message following conventional commits format
   - Execute commit with `git commit`

## Important

- Always read the guidelines first before committing
- The guidelines are authoritative and may have project-specific rules
- Follow the format exactly as specified

## Reference Files

All commit guidelines are maintained in the `.aiassisted/` directory:
- Commit prompt: `.aiassisted/prompts/git.commit.prompt.md`
- Conventional commits spec: `.aiassisted/instructions/conventional-commits.instructions.md`

These files are the source of truth and are always up-to-date.
